You play as a jellyfish trying to climb as high as possible in the ocean by<br />
as many platform in platform.<br />
The screen rises gradually automatically, the goal is not to fall to the bottom of<br />
the ocean.<br />
There is no goal other than to climb<br />
as high as possible, until the ocean absorbs you.<br />
The jellyfish can move from left to right<br />
with the arrow keys (left/right) and<br />
can jump with spacebar or arrow<br />
from the top.<br />
