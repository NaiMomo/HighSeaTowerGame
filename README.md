You play as a jellyfish trying to climb as high as possible in the ocean by
as many platform in platform.
The screen rises gradually automatically, the goal is not to fall to the bottom of
the ocean.
There is no goal other than to climb
as high as possible, until the ocean absorbs you.
The jellyfish can move from left to right
with the arrow keys (left/right) and
can jump with spacebar or arrow
from the top.
